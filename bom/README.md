# Interactive Bill of Materials (iBOM) for nRF52Buddy Board

**[Click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kanestoboi/nRF52Buddy-Hardware/blob/master/bom/ibom.html) to view the interactive bill of materials (iBOM) for the nRF52Buddy board.**

The interactive BOM was generated using InteractiveHtmlBom v2.6, which allows for a more interactive and user-friendly experience. The iBOM contains a list of all the components used in the nRF52Buddy board along with their part numbers, values, and quantities.

Users can search for specific components, filter by reference designators, and even export the BOM to a spreadsheet or text file. This makes it easier for users to navigate and identify the components needed for the project.

I hope that this interactive bill of materials will be helpful for anyone using the nRF52Buddy board in their projects. If you have any questions or suggestions.
